This repository contains a reimplementation of the Bayesian optimization approach described in the paper by Snoek et al. [1]. This implementation was created as part of the final project for ECE500 in the Spring of 2023. The code is based on the approach presented in the original paper as well as the existing package, [Spearmint](https://github.com/JasperSnoek/spearmint), written by the authors of the paper.

The dependent packages and their corresponding versions used in this implementation are as follows:
- numpy (version 1.23.5)
- scipy (version 1.9.3)

Gaussian Process and Bayesian optimization are performed based on these packages.

To test the code, I recommend running "prob1_branin_hoo.py" and "prob2_boston_housing.py", which will provide a good understanding of how the code works.
